# Microservices Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive microservices architecture designed to demonstrate the integration and interaction between various services, including Twitter stream processing, Kafka messaging, and Elasticsearch data storage. Below is an overview of the technology stack and frameworks used in this project.

## Technology Stack & Frameworks

### Java

- **Version**: Utilizes Java as the primary programming language, ensuring robust and platform-independent solutions.

### Maven

- **Build Tool**: Maven is used for project management and build automation, simplifying the process of managing project dependencies and packaging.

### Spring Boot

- **Core Framework**: Spring Boot is employed to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration.

### Spring Cloud Config

- **Configuration Management**: Manages externalized configuration in a distributed system, with support for centralized configuration management.

### Kafka

- **Messaging System**: Apache Kafka is used as a distributed streaming platform, facilitating the publishing and subscribing to streams of records, storing streams of records in a fault-tolerant way, and processing streams of records as they occur.

### Elasticsearch

- **Search and Analytics Engine**: Elasticsearch is utilized for its powerful full-text search capabilities, as well as its analytics and aggregation features. It serves as the primary data store for processed data.

### Confluent Schema Registry

- **Schema Management**: The project uses Confluent Schema Registry for managing Kafka data schemas and ensuring compatibility between different versions of data structures.

### Docker

- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the microservices, ensuring consistency across different development and deployment environments.

## Configuration

The project includes multiple YAML configuration files for different services, ensuring that each microservice can be independently configured and scaled. These configurations cover server ports, Kafka bootstrap servers, topic names, consumer group IDs, and Elasticsearch connection details, among others.

## Microservices

- **Twitter to Kafka Service**: Streams data from Twitter based on specified keywords and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
- **Kafka to Elasticsearch Service**: Consumes messages from a Kafka topic and stores them in Elasticsearch for further analysis and visualization.
- **Config Server**: Centralizes external configuration management across all microservices.

## Retry Configuration

A retry configuration is defined for resilient operation, allowing services to handle failures and transient issues gracefully.

## Serialization and Deserialization

- **KafkaAvroSerializer** and **KafkaAvroDeserializer** are used for message serialization and deserialization, ensuring that messages are efficiently encoded and decoded while preserving schema information.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies a modern microservices architecture, leveraging popular and powerful technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, and Elasticsearch. It demonstrates the processing of real-time data streams, distributed messaging, and data storage and analysis, providing a robust foundation for scalable and resilient microservice applications.
